in asp dotnet core 5, efcore does database connection persist?? or close after complete query??

In ASP.NET Core 5, Entity Framework Core (EF Core) manages the database connections for you, and the behavior of these connections can depend on how you configure your DbContext and how you use it within your application.

By default, EF Core uses a "scoped" service lifetime for the DbContext, which means that a new instance of the DbContext is created for each HTTP request (assuming you are using the default dependency injection setup). When a request is completed, the DbContext is disposed of, which also closes the associated database connection. This approach is known as "per-request" or "scoped" DbContext.

Here's a simplified example of how DbContext might be configured in the Startup.cs file of an ASP.NET Core application:

```
csharpCopy codepublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddDbContext<MyDbContext>(options =>
        options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
    
    // Other services configuration...
}

```

In the example above, `MyDbContext` is registered with a scoped lifetime by default, so it will be created at the beginning of each HTTP request and disposed of at the end of the request.

However, you can change the lifetime of the DbContext to better suit your needs. For example, you can configure it as a "singleton" if you want a single DbContext instance to be used throughout the lifetime of the application. This would also mean that the database connection remains open for the entire application's lifetime. Be cautious when using a singleton DbContext because it can lead to issues with data consistency and concurrency.

```
csharpCopy codeservices.AddDbContext<MyDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")), ServiceLifetime.Singleton);

```

In summary, in ASP.NET Core with EF Core, the database connection typically persists for the duration of the DbContext's lifetime, which can vary based on your configuration. By default, it is scoped to the HTTP request, and the connection is opened when the DbContext is created and closed when it is disposed of (at the end of the request). You can change the lifetime of the DbContext to control how long the database connection remains open.

Using a singleton DbContext in an ASP.NET Core application can lead to issues with data consistency and concurrency due to the way DbContext manages its internal state and tracks changes to entities.

Here's why using a singleton DbContext can be problematic:

1.  Lack of Isolation: A singleton DbContext instance is shared among all parts of your application, including multiple requests and concurrent operations. When multiple clients or threads access the same DbContext concurrently, they may inadvertently affect each other's data.
    
2.  Entity Tracking: DbContext keeps track of the state of entities it is working with. When changes are made to these entities, DbContext tracks those changes until they are either saved to the database or discarded. In a multi-user or multi-threaded scenario, changes made to entities by one client may interfere with or overwrite changes made by another client, leading to data inconsistency.
    
3.  Concurrency Issues: When multiple clients or threads modify the same database records simultaneously, you can encounter concurrency issues. For example, two clients might read a record at the same time, make changes to it, and then attempt to save it back to the database. Without proper handling, this can result in data conflicts and potential data loss.
    
4.  Transaction Management: DbContext manages database transactions. With a singleton DbContext, it becomes challenging to control and manage transactions for different units of work independently. This can make it difficult to ensure that multiple database operations are coordinated correctly within a single transaction.
    

To mitigate these issues, it's recommended to use a "scoped" or "transient" DbContext in ASP.NET Core applications, which ensures that each request or operation gets its own isolated DbContext instance. This way, changes made in one request do not affect other requests, and you have better control over transactions and concurrency. Scoped DbContext instances are disposed of at the end of each HTTP request, making it a safer choice for most web applications.

If you have scenarios where you need long-lived operations or background tasks that require database access, it's usually better to create and manage separate DbContext instances with appropriate lifetimes for those specific scenarios to maintain data isolation and consistency.

but in db connection start and close on every request is not it going to cpu expensive??

Opening and closing a database connection for every HTTP request in an ASP.NET Core application is not as CPU expensive as it might seem, primarily because modern database systems and connection pools are designed to efficiently handle connection creation and reuse. In fact, it's a common and recommended practice in web applications to use a "scoped" DbContext, where a new instance of DbContext is created for each request and is disposed of at the end of the request. Here's why this approach is generally efficient:

1.  Connection Pooling: Most database providers, including Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL, implement connection pooling. When you open a database connection and then close it, the underlying connection is not immediately terminated. Instead, it's returned to a pool of connections that can be reused for subsequent requests. This significantly reduces the overhead of opening and closing actual database connections.
    
2.  Thread Safety: DbContext instances in EF Core are not thread-safe by default. Using a new instance for each request ensures that the DbContext is used by only one thread at a time, eliminating the need for complex thread synchronization.
    
3.  Resource Cleanup: By using scoped DbContext instances, you ensure that resources (such as database connections, memory, and temporary objects) associated with the DbContext are released promptly when they are no longer needed, which can help prevent resource leaks.
    
4.  Simplicity and Isolation: Scoped DbContext instances align with the concept of request isolation. Each request operates on its own isolated data context, which simplifies data management and prevents data corruption or conflicts between concurrent requests.
    

If you are concerned about the performance impact of opening and closing database connections, consider the following best practices to optimize database access:

-   Connection Pool Tuning: Configure your database connection pool settings to match the expected workload and performance requirements. You can adjust settings like the maximum number of connections, timeout settings, and connection reuse behavior.
    
-   Efficient Queries: Write efficient SQL queries and optimize data access patterns to minimize the amount of data retrieved from the database.
    
-   Caching: Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the need for frequent database access for static or rarely changing data.
    
-   Connection Resiliency: Handle connection errors gracefully by implementing retry and circuit-breaking mechanisms to ensure robust database access.
    

In summary, using a scoped DbContext with a new database connection for each HTTP request is a recommended practice in ASP.NET Core because it provides isolation, simplicity, and safety, and it leverages the efficiency of connection pooling provided by most modern database systems. With proper configuration and optimization, the performance impact of opening and closing connections should be minimal and not a significant CPU expense.
